# Abstract

## Basic syntax

Here, we're going to learn that we can create a TS file to test it:

```json
let msg:string = "Hello World"
console.log(msg)
```

After that, we can run a command at terminal 

```json
tsc script.ts && node script.ts
```
Now, we have a new JS file

```json
var msg = "Hello World"
console.log(msg)
```

After this JS file creation we can also test out code in web console.

## Types 

![Types Diagram](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/typescript/images/data_types.jpg)

### The primitives: String, Number, and Boolean

The basic data types from which all other data types are constructed

### Void

Used on function return types to represent non-returning functions

### Null X Undefined


Null -> Absence of value

Undefined -> A variable that was not populated
