# Abstract

Here, we're going to learn that we can create a TS file to test it:

```json
let msg:string = "Hello World"
console.log(msg)
```

After that, we can run a command at terminal 

```json
tsc script.ts && node script.ts
```
Now, we have a new JS file

```json
var msg = "Hello World"
console.log(msg)
```

After this JS file creation we can also test out code in web console.
